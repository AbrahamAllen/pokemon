click anywhere on the map to move there<br>
click on your monster to see your stats<br>

move inside the animated biomes to find other monsters<br>
click on any of the attacks in the bottom right to use them<br>
attacks have a base power and an accuracey rating out of 100<br>
careful! the enemy will attack back if you dont kill them<br>
running away will always work!<br>
you can swap between monsters without using your turn<br>
beating an enemy allows you to eat them to heal, absorb them to grow stronger or capture them to add to your party<br>

the biomes will shrink as you find monsters in them<br>
eventually you wont be able to find monsters anymore<br>

some elements are more effective against others<br>
like water is great against fire!<br>
when youre ready, head to the portal to start the real game. <br>

youll be picking your own starter animal and element<br>
if you can get to the 10th floor theres a strong boss waiting for you.
